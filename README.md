# Email Log Analyzer

A beginner-friendly Python project to analyze email logs from `.txt` files.  
Built after completing the **Python for Everybody** course by Dr. Charles Severance.

---

## Project Description

This script reads a plain-text email log file (like `mbox-short.txt`) and extracts:

- **Top email senders**
- **Frequency of email domains** (e.g., `umich.edu`)
- **Number of emails sent by hour** (e.g., `15:00`)

All using just:
- File handling
- String parsing
- Python dictionaries
- Sorting

## Sample Input

Example line from the input log: From zqian@umich.edu Fri Jan 4 15:03:18 2008
